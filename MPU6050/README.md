MPU6050 STM32F103 Project

Reading accelerometer data from the MPU6050 sensor via I2C using an STM32F103 Blue Pill and transmitting the data to a computer via USB CDC.

What Is It Used For?

This project reads 3-axis (X, Y, Z) acceleration data from the MPU6050 accelerometer sensor and sends it to a computer over USB. When you move the sensor, you can observe real-time acceleration values on the terminal screen.

Hardware
